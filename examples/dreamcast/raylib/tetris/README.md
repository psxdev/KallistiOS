# Tetris-RayLib4DC
A simple recreation of Tetris using raylib and kallistios that runs on the sega dreamcast.

Anyone is free to do whatever they want with the code in this project.

## Purpose of this Repository
This is a simple recreation of tetris created using raylib following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM) by youtuber "[Programming With Nick](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick)". I wanted to create a game for the sega dreamcast and get it running on actual hardware, but don't actually have any real experience with dreamcast homebrew development or C/C++ development, so this repository is going to show my whole learning process.

I have decided to continue past the tutorial in order to further develop my skills and make a nicer Tetris experience. You can see this [here](https://github.com/Niisoks/Tetris-RayLib4DC). If you are here _just_ to see what the tutorial looks like on kallistios, [please check the branch titled "TutorialCompletion"](https://github.com/Niisoks/Tetris-RayLib4DC/tree/TutorialCompletion).
